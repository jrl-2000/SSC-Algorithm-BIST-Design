# SSC-Algorithm-BIST-Design
HDL Implementation of the Selection Sort Circuit Algorithm!

It adds one element in each iteration. You need to select the smallest element in the array and move it to the beginning of the array by swapping it with the front element.

Unfold to test the Combinational Logic Part.
